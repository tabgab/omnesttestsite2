<h2>Who needs a commercial license?</h2>

<p>Basically anyone who is doing commercial work with OMNEST/OMNeT++. In determining whether a
commercial license is needed, the purpose of the project must be
considered.</p>

<p style="line-height:110%"><small>
OMNEST and OMNeT++ are mostly identical except for licensing, branding, and the presence
of extra components and features in OMNEST (<a href="comparison">comparison</a>).</small></p>

<ul>
    <li>One exception is
    if the partner only receives a stand-alone simulation that is only
    capable of emulating a device or piece of code that needs to be used
    in a "hardware in the loop" simulation. This kind of
    "virtual prototyping" is possible through the normal
    license, but we also have runtime licenses available for this
    purpose if the partner does not want, or can not make use of the
    full OMNEST system.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Q:</b> I am an individual, and would like to evaluate OMNEST
to get to know the software. What do I do?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> You can use the OMNEST evaluation version or the
noncommercial version OMNeT++ for learning the software.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> We are a company, and would like to evaluate OMNEST
in our environment before purchasing it. What should we do?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> You are welcome to download and try the evaluation version
of OMNEST. You can evaluate OMNEST free of charge, and receive
technical support during evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> I am a student at a
university, our university is working in partnership together with
industry, and I have been given an assignment as part of that
program. Can I make use of the free version for this assignment?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> While you are
welcome to use OMNeT++ for educational purposes, and it is a matter
of principle for us to provide our software for free for educational
purposes, assignments of this kind require a commercial license. Such
kind of co-operation between universities and industry is in essence
an out-sourcing of industrial research to the university lab. While
this provides opportunity for students to work on real-life problems
and provides extra funding to universities, the cost of commercial
licenses must be factored in, since the research being performed is
commercially oriented.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> We use OMNEST in our company to develop simulations.
I need to make a presentation from a different computer. Do I need
an extra license?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> We use OMNEST in our company to develop simulations.
I would like to send simulations to our partner(s) for evaluation.
What licensing options are available?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> If your partner has
an OMNEST license, then this will be covered by it. If your partner
does not have an OMNEST license, then you will have to produce and
distribute a self-contained simulation that also contains part of the
OMNEST framework. Please contact us to discuss this option. You(or
your partner) may purchase runtime licenses to cover the distribution
and use of such narrow-scope prototypes. More complicated
applications that embed the OMNEST simulation kernel will need a
custom embedding license.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> To show off our results, I have recorded a movie of the
simulation running, and sent our results off to a partner. Do I, or do
they need to have a license?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> No. All intellectual property you produce in OMNEST is yours.
You can distribute it on your own terms, or use it internally as you please.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Can I re-distribute my simulations in souce-code form?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> Yes. All intellectual property you produce in OMNEST is yours. You can
distribute it on your own terms, or use it internally as you please.</p>
