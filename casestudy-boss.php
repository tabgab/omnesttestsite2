<div id="header"><h1>Case Study &ndash; The Celtic BOSS Project (Railway on-board wireless secured video surveillance)</h1></div>

<p>The purpose of the BOSS project was to design and develop a prototype for
an efficient railway communication system. This system was aimed at
supporting the high demands of an audio/video surveillance system in a rolling
train from a control center on the wayside, and also addressing related
issues, such as predictive maintenance. The system is based on WiMAX/HSUPA
(outdoors, towards the control center) and WiFi (indoors) networks.

<p>The functional architecture was developed into a full communication
architecture as an OMNeT++ simulation model. The model was enriched
throughout the project's lifetime by the modules and algorithms developed
within the project's technical packages on radio communications,
signaling, adaptation to impairments, efficient multimedia compression,
and abnormal events detection.</p>

<p><i>"The OMNeT++ simulator was a key element to ensure the first validation of the
system before prototyping, the establishment of initial working
settings for the demonstration phase, and the measurement and
assessment of techniques that will not be realistically implantable in the
BOSS demonstrator,"</i> they write.</p>

<p>The BOSS consortium consists of THALES Communications France,
Alstom-Transport, SNCF, INRETS, UPMC (France), UCL, BARCO-SILEX (Belgium),
TELEFONICA I+D, Arteixo-Telecom, INECO (Spain), BME, E-GROUP (Hungary).
