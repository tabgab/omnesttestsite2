Researchers at the Lightwave Research Laboratory, Columbia University
have been working on exploring architectural aspects of future on-chip
photonic (as opposed to electronic) networks.
Recent advancements in silicon nano-photonic technology have opened the
possibility of integrating photonics for chip-scale interconnection
networks. In comparison to electronics, photonics has the potential to
offer higher-bandwidth connections by leveraging data parallelism offered
by wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM). Many photonic topologies
have been proposed by other researchers in an effort to improve computing
performance, but so far less emphasis has been placed on understanding whether
such designs are feasible from a physical-layer standpoint.
</p>

<p>The group has used OMNeT++ simulations to perform detailed physical-layer
analysis of chip-scale photonic interconnection networks; to the authors'
best knowledge, this is the first such detailed physical-layer analysis.
They used simulation because it is not currently practical to test full network
topologies in a laboratory environment. The simulation framework they have
developed has been published as open-source software.
</p>

<p>The PhoenixSim simulator is based on the OMNeT++ simulation environment, and it
incorporates detailed physical models of basic photonic building blocks
such as waveguides, modulators, photodetectors, and switches. More complex
photonic circuits and full topologies can be created by properly arranging
these building blocks. These composite structures can then be analyzed
within the simulator to determine the overall performance characteristics.
</p>

<p>In the quoted study, the group evaluated a previously proposed interconnection
topology (Torus) and two newly introduced ones, TorusNX and Square
Root, and explored the impact of three physical-layer metrics on system
scalability, performance, and efficiency. This is only a first result;
as the PhoenixSim simulator allows researchers to analyze the overall
scalability and performance of various network designs in terms of
physical-layer metrics such as insertion loss, crosstalk, and energy,
many more results can be expected, contributing to the eventual realization
of practical on-chip photonic networks.
